## "Don't Make Me Think"
  * [read this](https://www.amazon.ca/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758) great introduction on how to best help your users succeed with your product.

## Use Systems
  * Use Flowbite, a Figma+CSS designs system, to help make the default design obvious and attractive.
  * When developing a component, break them apart (decompose) based on how they will be re-used.
  * Always check if an component you're building already exists, or a similar one does you can re-use.

## Always auto-fill default values
  * Where possible, auto-fill the correct value and do not ask the user to enter data.
  * 
  * When there is optional fields that are rarely used, group them and hide them in "advanced" or "more" section.

## Reduce the number of clicks
  * Allow the user to accomplish their task with as few clicks and interactions as possible.
  * What can you automate for them or avoid making them do?

## Improve performance
  * Prefer lightweight libraries (Mobx, Preact, Fetch) over heavy ones (Redux, React, Axios)
  * If possible, everything should load in 100ms
  * Nothing should take more than 2 seconds to load in the user's experience

## Get Feedback
  * Share a video of your work with the team. Call out specific members who should review.
  * Show your team in meetings by screen-sharing.
  * Show customers, and ideally watch while they use it. (Usability testing)
  * Meet with customers and ask them about their problems and goals. (User Interviews)
